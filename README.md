[![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/013be486-8ca2-48da-a3ae-da79a350eda1)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-vanyaland-android-developer-by-google-master)

Become an Android Developer.

This is a repository where I will be posting the apps that I built during my [Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) study.

## About This Nanodegree

For intermediate Java developers pursuing Android specialization, this program teaches the tools, principles, and patterns that underlie all Android development.

The skills you learn in this Nanodegree program will help you master the existing platform, and prepare you for the exciting opportunities in Android's future.

## Capstone

- Create a detailed plan, including UI mocks and technical specifications, for building app
- Take the skills that I've learned across your Nanodegree journey and apply it to an app idea

**Certificate**: [Verified Certificate of Completion](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wdh752fdlaoy2y2/android-developer-nd-grad-cert.pdf?dl=0)

**Project**: [Habito](https://github.com/vanyaland/Habito)

Simple habit tracker with Firebase Services and detailed charts.

**Toy apps**:

- [FriendlyChat](../master/FriendlyChat) a Firebase demo project


## Developing Android Apps, Stage 1
ListViews, Activities, Intents, Content Providers

- Build and deploy apps on Android devices
- Present and use network resources in your apps
- Navigate between multiple screens in an app
- Create databases and use Content Providers to manage access to your data
- Create responsive user interfaces that work across a variety of screen sizes
- Keep your app running efficiently with the Use of AsyncTasks and Loaders

**Project**: [Popular Movies](https://github.com/vanyaland/Popular-Movies)

Create an app that allows users to discover recent and popular movies.

This app consists of two parts. In the first, you’ll build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user. In the second, you’ll add a tablet layout with detail views for each movie, allowing users to favorite certain films.

**Toy apps**:

- [FavoriteToys](../master/FavoriteToys) - present scrollable data in ScrollView with nested TextView
- [GithubQuery](../master/GithubQuery) - connect to the Internet and communicate with GitHub API
- [RecyclerView](../master/RecyclerView) - learn about the components that convert a list of data into visual UI elements
- [Sunshine](../master/Sunshine) is a weather forecast app

## Developing Android Apps, Stage 2
The Application Lifecycle, Preferences, SQLite Databases, Content Providers,
Background Tasks, Responsive Layout

- Understand the phases of the Android application lifecycle
- Learn how to persist data between orientation and other changes
- Allow users to customize some aspects of your app using Preferences
- Implement an SQLite database and make queries to and modify that database in app
- Learn how Content Providers provide an interface to share data and consume data from an already existing ContentProvider
- Learn how to efficiently implement Background Tasks

**Project**: [Popular Movies](https://github.com/vanyaland/Popular-Movies)

Add onto Popular Movies Stage 1 project a detail view for each movie, allowing users to ‘favorite’ movies, and adding a persistence.

**Toy apps**:

- [Visualizer](../master/Visualizer) - use the SharedPreferences to allow users to customize some aspects of app
- [Waitlist](../master/Waitlist) - create SQLite database, save and query data using SQLiteOpenHelper class
- [Quiz-Example](../master/Quiz-Example) - consume data from an already existing ContentProvider
- [ToDo-List](../master/ToDo-List) - build SQLite database and use ContentProvider to get the data
- [Hydration-Reminder](../master/Hydration-Reminder) - learn how to schedule background tasks and present notifications
- [BoardingPass](../master/BoardingPass) - learn ConstraintLayour
- [VisualPolish](../master/VisualPolish) - create responsive user interfaces 
- [Sunshine](../master/Sunshine) - weather forecast app, that demonstrates every covered aspect in the course

## Advanced Android App Development
